    "**The results:**\n",
    "* We conducted Welch's T-Test for each app and its most similar app (according cosine similarity)\n",

    "Based on the statistical analysis, I found that the percentage of tests failing to reject the null hypothesis is 22.22%, while the percentage of tests rejecting the null hypothesis is 77.78%. This inconsistency indicates that the hypothesis is not supported by the data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The majority of apps (77.78%) showed significant differences in prices between similar apps, suggesting that app descriptions alone may not be a reliable predictor of pricing in app auctions. Further investigation and refinement of the hypothesis are recommended to establish a stronger relationship between app descriptions and prices in auctions."

In contrast, 42.07% of the hypothesis tests rejected the null hypothesis, suggesting that there are significant differences in prices between apps with similar countryCode. Therefore, the hypothesis is not consistent across the dataset, and the assumption of similar prices for apps with the same countryCode is not supported by the statistical analysis."

    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test results show that there are significant differences in sentPrice between applications with different operation systems (OS). Specifically:\n",
    "* For applications with OS Android, the Kruskal-Wallis H-statistic is $2202.14$, and the p-value is $0.0$, indicating a significant difference in sentPrice.\n",
    "* For applications with OS iOS, the Kruskal-Wallis H-statistic is $567.06$, and the p-value is approximately $2.81e-117$, also indicating a significant difference in sentPrice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the hypothesis that applications with the same OS have the same sentPrice is rejected based on the Kruskal-Wallis test results, ,and the assumption of similar prices for apps with the same OS is not supported by the statistical analysis."
